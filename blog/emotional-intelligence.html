      <p class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence? And how is it different to IQ? And why is it so important?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">My understanding of Emotional Intelligence also known as EQ is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions.
        Recognizing your emotions and understanding what they are telling you can improve your quality of life. 
        It is important when it comes to having a successful relationship with yourself and with others. </p>

      <p class="paragraph">IQ is the measurement of your ability to solve problems, using logic and understanding complex ideas, where EQ is the measurement your ability
        to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to make decisions.

      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">



        Emotional Intelligence is important as it allows you to empathize with others, communicate effectively, and be self-aware and socially aware. How we look at ourselves and others impacts our surroundings. Soooo many people are in this world and over the course of our lifetime we meet many different types of people and EQ is key to how you respond to what life throws at you. Is it key to compassion and understanding the reasons behind othersâ€™ actions. It is also important when dealing with stressful  obstacles and conflicts
