      <h1 class="title">Reflecting on Foundations</h1>
      <h2 class="undertitle">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
      
      <p class="paragraph">Throughtout foundations I learnt alot about myself especially doing the core content. 
        The first thing that stands out for me is reflecting. I did not realise how much I reflected on everything 
        I do in my everyday life until I started foundations, and now that I am aware of it I can use it to improve 
        not only my everyday life my to learning journey. Also I learnt that I am very good at helping others there 
        were times people were stuck and I was able to help out which I really enjoyed. Also I learnt that I am on 
        the right learning path, these core skills I have been practising for the past year, and I feel like this is 
        something I am suppose to be doing. I am happy with where I am at in my life and I feel like this course can 
        bring me so many opportunities.
      </p>

      <h2 class="undertitle">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">They play a important role when it comes to working in a programming environment, without these core skills you will struggle to have a successful career. They play a important role in making connections, workin in a team, helping others. Things that are important in a programming role.</p>

      <h2 class="undertitle">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">To be honest I was surprised, but I honestly enjoy it, I think learning this core content is something I needed. Its enjoyable to learn and practise. I think these soft skills are something everyone should practise and learn about.</p>
      
      <h2 class="undertitle">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I think the most challenging is practising them and actually doing it everyday can be a challenge with most poople, even for myself. Staying constant and working on it everyday is important. Understanding is the easy part but actually doing it can be a challenge, something im still working on. </p>
      
      <h2 class="undertitle">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Because working in a web development environment or any technical environment having these soft skills are important, being able to communicate with others is important, being able to give and receive feedback. Being able to work in a team and individually is important. Alot of the soft skills are important to have because without them you would struggle to even find a job in programming, people want to be able to work with people that have these soft skills which will make everyones job esier and also make the work environment a positive and happy place to work.</p>
      <h2 class="undertitle">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">No I really like it , alot of it I have been practising for the past year, and it makes totally sense why it goes hand to hand with programming. Core skills are just as important as technical skills if not more important. I really have enjoed it I feel like its going to improve my skills dramatically during this course. </p>
