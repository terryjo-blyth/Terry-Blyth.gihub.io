      <h2 class="question1">Describe your core personal values</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Kia Ora, my name is Terry Jo Blyth I am from Manutuke on the East Coast of Gisborne, 
growing up I went to Manutuke School where I learnt Te Reo Maori, which was my first language growing up, 
I also did Kapa Haka winning regionals numerous times and winning the New Zealand Primary School Kapa Haka 
Competition, my culture taught me alot not only about myself but about this Aorangi (Universe). Maori Values 
like "Manaakitanga '' looking out for others, "Whanaungatanga" the importance of building and fostering 
relationships, "Kaitiakitanga" looking after the environment and everything for future generations. 
"Kotahitanga" unity working together as one, "Maramatanga'' Understanding & Enlightenment, without my culture 
I wouldn't be the person I am today.</p>

<p class="paragraph">After high school I ended up working as a cellar operator making wine, working in a 
winery I gained a lot of experience I ended up training a lot of people from all over the world, I loved it 
but sometimes it was really hard trying to train someone who could barely speak english, but it taught me a 
lot of patience and understanding.</p>

<p class="paragraph">A consequence turned into a positive I guess was when I caught a taxi after a night out, 
I saw a phone on the floor of the taxi, feeling tipsy I thought the phone was mine, I picked it up and when I 
arrived Home I went to sleep. When I woke up in the morning I then realized the phone wasn't mine, I felt bad 
inside I wanted to find the owner, I checked if it had a passcode and it didn't have one, so I went through the
contact list and I found one of my good mates number saved, so I decided to message him on the phone, he 
replied not long after saying the phone belong to his aunty who was my teacher at School. So he got in contact 
with me and not long after she turned up to my house to pick up her phone. To see how happy she was to get her
phone back made me feel good inside again. When I reflect on the situation I see values like Manaakitanga and 
Aroha, respect and compassion.</p>

<h2 class="question1">Describe your strengths and limitations</h2>

<p class="paragraph">I am a very determined person, that is willing to learn and if I want something I like to 
put 100% in everything I am doing. As I have gotten older I have become very patient and understanding. Some 
limitations I want to work on and hopefully become better at are things like doubting myself thinking I can’t 
do it, my social skills I am horrible at keeping conversations going or talking in large groups, and my 
confidence. But in saying that I am getting there, the past year I have focused a lot on mindset and having a 
positive outcome on life, which has been working great so far.</p>

<p class="paragraph">If I am interested in something I will do it, for example this course, I am very 
determined to complete this course to the best of my ability. I have my plan and goals set and I am willing 
to put 100% in everything. I just need to stay in a positive mindset and block out those limiting beliefs and 
as time goes I can see those beliefs turn into strengths.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Working at a winery as a cellar operator can become pretty stressful at times. Working 80+ 
hour weeks during the vintage season can take a toll on a person. At first it was hard but I enjoyed the work. 
I enjoyed the people I was working with. It was just a good environment to be in. The past 8 years working 
there were some of the best years of my life. I met some amazing people from all over the world who I had 
the privilege to teach or even learn off. But as time went on I realised I didn’t want to work in the wine 
industry my whole life working 80+ weeks, I could see the effects it had on some people there and I didn’t want
to grow old turning out like them, because I could see it was affecting me already, after 8 years working there 
I realised I wasn’t enjoying it like I use to it just started feeling like a job, and my boss could see it 
tension started growing between us and around that time I was just  learning about positive mindset, so I 
started really thinking do I really want to be here? Or am I taking this amazing job for granted? 
All these mixed thoughts ran through my head, it was a really hard decision to make because it was just a 
great place to work, everyone was amazing, the work was cool, I really loved it but at the same time I couldn't 
see me working there for the rest of my life, so I made the tough decision and I handed in my notice, at first 
I was scared because I had no plan, no job nothing. But I told myself to keep positive and that something is coming. 
Not long after I finished I got a call about this course and honestly when I got that phone call I felt happy inside. 
I felt instantly like I made the right decision. I feel like this course was my calling sign and I am very 
committed.</p>
