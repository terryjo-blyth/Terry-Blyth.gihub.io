      <h2 class="question1">Describe your core personal values</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Kia Ora, my name is Terry Jo Blyth I am from Manutuke on the East Coast of Gisborne, growing up
I went to Manutuke School where I learnt Te Reo Maori, which was my first language growing up, I also did Kapa Haka
winning reginals numerious times and winning the New Zealand Primary School Kapa Haka Competetion, my culture taught me alot not only
about myself but about this Aorangi (Universe). Maori Values like "Manaakitanga" looking out for others, "Whanaungatanga" the importance of
building and fostering relationships, "Kaitiakitanga" looking after the environment and everything for future generations. 
"Kotahitanga" unity working together as one, "Maramatanga" Understanding & Enlightenment, without my culture 
I wouldn't be the person I am today. </p>

<p class="paragraph">After high school I ended up working as a cellar operator making wine, working in a winery I gained alot of experince I ended up training alot of people 
  from all over the world, I loved it but sometimes it was really hard trying to train someone who could barely speak english, but it taught me alot of patience and understanding.

</p>


<p class="paragraph">A consequence turned into a positive I guess was when I caught a taxi after a night out, I 
  saw a phone on the floor of the taxi, feeling tipsy I thought the phone was mine, I picked it up and when I arrived Home
  I went ot sleep. When I woke up in the morning I then realized the phone wasn't mine, I felt bad inside I wanted to find
  the owner, I checked if it had a passcode and it didn't have one, so I went through the contact list and I found one of my good
  mates number saved, so I decided to message him on the phone, he replied not long after saying the phone belong to his aunty who was my teacher at School.
  She turned up to my house to pick her phone up not long after. To see how happy she was to get her phone back made me feel good inside again. When 
  I reflect on the situation I see values like Manaakitanga and Aroha, respect and compassion. 
</p>
<h2 class="question">Describe your strengths and limitations</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I like to think I pick things up fairly esily and work good with others, I like to work hard but sometimes I can become a perfectionist which can become a bad thing, because
  it can lead towards me getting frustrated and become unmotivated. I think
