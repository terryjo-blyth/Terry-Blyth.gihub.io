      <p class="paragraph">Kia Ora, my name is Terry Jo Blyth I am from Manutuke on the East Coast of Gisborne, growing up
I went to Manutuke School where I learnt Te Reo Maori, which was my first language growing up, I also did Kapa Haka
winning reginals numerious times and winning the New Zealand Primary School Kapa Haka Competetion, my culture taught me alot not only
about myself but about this Aorangi (Universe). Maori Values like "Manaakitanga" looking out for others, "Whanaungatanga" the importance of
building and fostering relationships, "Kaitiakitanga" looking after the environment and everything for future generations. 
"Kotahitanga" unity working together as one, "Maramatanga" Understanding & Enlightenment, without my culture 
I wouldn't be the person I am today.</p>

<h2 class="question">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h2>
<p class="paragraph">One saturday night a few weekends ago I was in the city having a few drinks with my mates when it was time for me to go Home
  I caught a taxi when I arrived home and as I was getting out of the taxi I saw a phone on the ground being drunk I thought
  the phone was mine so I took it and went inside, the next morning I woke up I then realised that the phone wasn't mine, so I had to think
  what could I do, because someone is out there wondering where there phone is, I knew would feel bad if I didn't try and find the owner, 
  so I thought I would check if the phone had a passcode and it didn't have one , so I went through her contacts and I saw one of my best
  mates number was on the phone so I messaged my mate using the phone I found and told him I had this phone and If he knew whos phone it was, he replied not
  long after and said the phone belonged to hes aunty who was one of my high school teachers, so he got in contact
