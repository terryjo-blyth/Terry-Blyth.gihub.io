<h1 class="title">My Learning Plan</h1>
     
<h2 class="question1">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Honestly, my long term goal is just to get good at what I do and get a good job. 
Coming from a small place like Gisborne, there's not many opportunities here and I want to experience 
much more and I feel like the I.T industry can help with that.</p>

<h2 class="question1">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h2>

<p class="paragraph">I am a very motivated person, when I wanna do something I won’t stop until it is done, 
  I like to work hard and keep focused. Sometimes I can doubt myself and think I can’t do it, I just need to 
  stay positive and believe in myself.</p>

<h2 class="question1">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself 
  while at Dev Academy?</h2>

<p class="paragraph">My social skills to learn to keep conversations going, talking in large groups. 
  My confidence in being able to believe in myself.</p>

  <h2 class="question1">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program</h2>

<p class="paragraph">I have written a weekly plan that I want to try and keep sticking to, studying at 
  least 6-8 hours a day and a few hours at night, I make sure I take enough breaks during the day so 
  I’m staying grounded, every morning I like to do a 15-minute meditation when I get up,  to relax 
  my mind and to set my intentions for the day.  I am fully committed to this course. I am happy to learn by 
  myself and within a group, I like to get along with others and make sure everyone feels included, and also 
  to help others when they need help, I like to treat this as a job and be professional in everything I do, 
  staying in contact with students or the facilitator and sticking to deadlines. If I don’t know what I’m 
  doing I am not afraid to ask questions or ask for help. If I feel myself feeling blocked it’s good to 
  just take a break and meditate, release all the tension.</p>
