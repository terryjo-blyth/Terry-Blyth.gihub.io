<h1 class="title">My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

<h2 class="undertitle">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

<p class="paragraph">My long-term goal is to be competent in full-stack programming and to use those skills to 
  land a job, I don’t mind where start off at, I feel like once I have my foot inside the door of the I.T world 
  opportunities will arise. </p>

  <h2 class="undertitle">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
  </h2>

  <p class="paragraph">I found during foundations that I was really good at helping others something I never 
    realized before starting this course, I also found that I was good at problem-solving when I or someone 
    ran into a problem. Also found that I am a quick learner which I think is important in the tech industry 
    which is always involving. I think these strengths will help a lot during Bootcamp. One limitation I think 
    I need to work on is my writing, I found it hard during foundations to write my blog post something I really 
    want to improve on. Found it very complicated to put content together and put thoughts down to paper.</p>

    <h2 class="undertitle">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">Some of the biggest challenges I think I will face during Bootcamp will be, Speaking in 
      large groups of people. Something I want to work on during Bootcamp. Also being a perfectionist all the time 
      will challenge me a lot. During foundations, I found myself a lot trying to make things perfect when they 
      were okay how they were. Sometimes I just needed to stop and move on to the next task or sprint. I think I 
      just need to have confidence in everything I do during Bootcamp and back myself and I should be okay. I find 
      when you start doubting yourself thats when problems start popping up. Just need to beleive and be confident.
    </p>

    <h2 class="undertitle">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">Theres alot I want to improve on during Bootcamp, I want to improve my self-confidence, being able to talk in front of large groups, to keep conversations going, give and receive feedback.
      I want to also improve on my english and writing as I was struggling to put thoughts to words on paper. I also want to work on my patience sometimes I feel like I get impatience and want things done straight away. Also my critical thinking and problem solving being able to plan and solve problems without getting impatience or being self critical things I really want to work on during Bootcamp.
      </p>

      <h2 class="undertitle">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>

      <p class="paragraph">I would say I would just expect the same as foundations, my facilitator showed she 
        cared and was always there to help which I really liked, it made me feel comfortable knowing there was 
        someone we could go to if I ever felt stuck or blocked. I don’t really have much expectations from the 
        Bootcamp team as I see its up to me if I really want this. I can’t put expectations fully on the team, 
        when I have to be fully committed which I feel like I am .</p>

        <h2 class="undertitle">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">To be honest I have high expectations in myself, I want to work hard and give Bootcamp 
          my 100% all. I expect myself to be fully committed during the 9 weeks, I keep telling myself to be 
          confident and to full back myself. I know bootcamp will be challenging for myself not just for the 
          technical content but with core, its a challenge I am happy to take on and just want to give my all.</p>
<h1 class="title">My Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

     
<h2 class="undertitle">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Honestly, my long term goal is just to get good at what I do and get a good job. 
Coming from a small place like Gisborne, there's not many opportunities here and I want to experience 
much more and I feel like the I.T industry can help with that.</p>

<h2 class="undertitle">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h2>

<p class="paragraph">I am a very motivated person, when I wanna do something I won’t stop until it is done, 
  I like to work hard and keep focused. Sometimes I can doubt myself and think I can’t do it, I just need to 
  stay positive and believe in myself.</p>

 

<h2 class="undertitle">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself 
  while at Dev Academy?</h2>

<p class="paragraph">My social skills to learn to keep conversations going, talking in large groups. 
  My confidence in being able to believe in myself.</p>

  <h2 class="undertitle">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program</h2>

<p class="paragraph">I have written a weekly plan that I want to try and keep to, studying at 
  least 6-8 hours a day and a few hours at night, I make sure I take enough breaks during the day so 
  I’m staying grounded, every morning I like to do a 15-minute meditation when I get up,  to relax 
  my mind and to set my intentions for the day.  I am fully committed to this course. I am happy to learn by 
  myself and within a group, I like to get along with others and make sure everyone feels included, and also 
  to help others when they need help, I like to treat this as a job and be professional in everything I do, 
  staying in contact with students or the facilitator and sticking to deadlines. If I don’t know what I’m 
  doing I am not afraid to ask questions or ask for help. If I feel myself feeling blocked it’s good to 
  just take a break and meditate, release all the tension.</p>
