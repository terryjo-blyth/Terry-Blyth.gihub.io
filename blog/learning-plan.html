    <h1 class="title">My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 class="question1">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
<p class="paragraph">To become competent in coding, I want to experience everything in I.T from Web developmet, 
Game Development, Apps development anything that does coding I want to experince it</p>
    <h2 class="question1">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I am a very motivated person, when I wanna do something I won’t stop until it is done, 
I like to work hard and keep focused. Sometimes I can become a perfectionist which can be bad, sometimes I want things to be perfect 
          when really it doesn’t need to be which can lead to not finishing the project or becoming unmotivated. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">After high school I ended up working as a cellar operator making wine, working in a winery I gained alot of experince I ended up training alot of people 
        from all over the world, I loved it but sometimes it was really hard trying to train someone who could barely speak english, but it taught me alot of patience and understanding.</p>
        <h2 class="question1">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I would like to develop my communication skills and my confidence as it will be important when I enter the I.T industry and also my time management skills.</p>
        <p class="question1">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I have written a weekly plan that I want to try and keep sticking to, 
          studying at least 6 hours a day and a few hours at night, I make sure I take enough breaks during 
          the day so I’m staying grounded, every morning I like to do a 15-minute meditation when I get up, 
           to relax my mindset and to set my intentions for the day.  I am fully committed to this course. 
           I am happy to learn by myself and within a group, I like to get along with others and make 
           sure everyone feels included, and also to help others when they need help, I like to treat 
           this as a job and be professional in everything I do, staying in contact with students 
           or the facilitator and sticking to deadlines. If I don’t know what I’m doing I am not 
           afraid to ask questions or ask for help. If I feel myself feeling blocked it’s good 
           to just take a break and meditate, release all the tension, 
          and hopefully I can come back to the problem with a clear mindset and a better understanding. </p>
          <p class="question1">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
            These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
