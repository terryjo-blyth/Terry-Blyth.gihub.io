      <h1 class="title">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Knowing the differences between Classes and IDs will help you tremendously as a web developer when it comes down to design. So let's first ask</p>
      <h1 class="undertitle">How do websites work?</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">A website is first constructed using HTML or HyperLink Text Markup Language, we use HTML to construct the basic structure of the website, once we are happy with the structure we can move on to design, which then we will use CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Think of it as a house, HTML is the basic foundation of the house and CSS is all the furniture in that house and everything to make the house look good. Same thing in Web Development. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Now that we have a basic understanding of how web pages work let's move on to what are classes and IDs.</p>
<h1 class="undertitle">What are Classes and IDs?</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Classes and IDs are both element selectors, we can assign them to certain elements we want to style.
</p>   
<p class="paragraph">Again using the house example again, if we wanted all the walls in the house to be white but one of the rooms we wanted the walls black instead, well you would give the walls a class name of say WhiteWalls and the wall you want black, you would give it an ID of BlackWalls.
</p>   
<p class="paragraph">So when you go into your CSS or Cascading Style Sheet you can then apply white to the classes WhiteWalls and it won’t affect the wall you want black because you gave it different IDs or Class names. 
</p>
<p class="paragraph">So in short Classes should be used when you want to style multiple elements on multiple pages, and IDs are used when you want to change only a single element. 
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Some best practices when it comes to Classes and IDs.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">If more than one element needs styling make sure to Classes
</p>
<p class="paragraph">If you are only styling one element then use IDs
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Name your classes or IDs something that defines that function for example “Navigation”
