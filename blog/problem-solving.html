      <h1 class="title">Problem Solving</h1>
      <h2 class="undertitle">Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>

      <p class="paragraph">One simple problem I had gotten stuck and felt blocked on was when we had to do the Javascript challenges during sprint 3, I was stuck on a question for over an hour. I knew I was close but still didnâ€™t know what it was, So I decided I would move on to the next question and come back to it. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="undertitle">Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h2>

      <p class="paragraph">Before I went back to the question I took a long break just to relax my mind I felt like I needed time away from the computer and once I came back to the question I felt like my mind was calm. I took my time to look at the question and the answer I had put down. But since I was in a calm state I was able to see what was the problem, it was a simple problem all I needed to do was change the double quotation marks to singular quotation marks, and the problem was resolved. I believe taking a break from the computer relaxing my mind helped me resolve the problem. I learned that I need to take regular breaks when I am feeling blocked, I should ask others to check my work as they might be able to see the problem.  </p>

    <h2 class="undertitle">Pseudocode</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Pseudocode is great because it is good when planning out coding projects before even starting, it helps 
     create algorithms in a way that is esier to read, because one real coding comes in it can become harder to understand and read.
   </p>


   <h2 class="undertitle">Trying Something</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">I think trying something is great too because it is how I learnt alot, trying and testing different codes out helps me improve my coding skills.
   </p>

   <h2 class="undertitle">Rubber ducky method</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">It is a interesting method but I do understand the logic behind it, its make me realise that it is important to be able to explain a line code for code not only to explain to a "rubber duck" or for yourself. As it will be important to be able to explain the line of codes as simple as possible.
   </p>

   <h2 class="undertitle">Reading error messages</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Reading error messages are great because they can tell you exactly where the problem is.
   </p>

   <h2 class="undertitle">Console.logging</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Console.logging is important as it is a way to see if your code is working in the background and to check for any problems.
   </p>

   <h2 class="undertitle">Googling</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Google is great everyone uses it when we are stuck on a problem or want to learn something new
   </p>


   <h2 class="undertitle">Asking your peers for helpv</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Something I am still getting use too, as I am so use to doing things for myself, working things out for myself. But it is good to ask others for help, there have been times during the sprints I was stuck and asking for help did help alot.
   </p>

   <h2 class="undertitle">Asking coaches for help</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Same as above, something I am still getting use too, as I am so use to doing things for myself.
   </p>

   <h2 class="undertitle">Improving your process with reflection</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Since learning about reflecting at the start of sprint 1. I think it is amazing, It helps you to learn so much. It is so true without reflection there is no learning and I think that is correc, reflecting on our learning is so important.
