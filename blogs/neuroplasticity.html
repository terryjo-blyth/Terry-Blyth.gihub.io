   <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
   <p class=paragraph>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt. The basic principles have many benefits, from learning new things, adapting to change. If we focus on a task and we are motivated and engaged to get it done our brains release neurochemicals but if we are the opposite unmotivated and unengaged our brains donâ€™t release neurochemicals. But at the end of the day focusing on our brain health is one of the best things we can do for ourselves to improve concentration, focus, memory, and mental agility. If we incorporate brain exercises into our everyday lives and challenge our minds, we will sharpen our skills and have a much happier enriching life. </p>

   <p class=paragraph>Ways to increase our neuroplasticity is doing things like complicated puzzles to get your brain working, research even shows playing videos games can increase our neuroplastic from reaction time, coordination, problem-solving. Even learning a new language can help with neuroplasticity, helps with attention, emotions, memory, and motor skills.</p>

   <h5>Growth Mindset</h5>
   <p class=paragraph>A growth Mindset is someone who believes their talents can be improved and worked on through hard work, determination, good strategies, and taking information from others. It is relevant because it can help you overcome obstacles when learning something new or a new skill. Recognizing the importance of determination and persistence you can change your mindset and the way you learn. </p>

  
   <p class=paragraph>Even though I have been learning about Growth Mindset for the past year, this was good to do again, Especially while doing this course, it has given me the extra boost that I needed to believe in myself . </p>

   
   <p class=paragraph>I have already intergrated growth mindset into my learning plan, from doing simples things like waking up and making my bed completing a simple task can set your mood for the day, making sure I meditate before I start my day off and set my intentions for the day. Setting goals for the day and week and completing them and also challenging myself with regular task and test. </p>
